# Dynatrace ActiveGate Operator

This is the home of Dynatrace ActiveGate Operator which supports the rollout and lifecycle of Dynatrace ActiveGate in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.

The existing Dynatrace ActiveGate has been available since 2016 supporting a number of capabilities including API monitoring for Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, and vSPhere. Many of these capabilities will be migrated to this container-based ActiveGate over time. As of December 2020 it is limited to Kubernetes monitoring alone.
